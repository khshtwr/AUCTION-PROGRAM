Blind Auction Program
Welcome to the Blind Auction Program! This Python-based application allows users to participate in a secret auction where bids are placed privately, and the highest bidder wins.

Features
Blind Auction: Participants place their bids secretly.
Dictionary Storage: Bids are stored in dictionaries for easy access and management.
Nesting: Utilizes nested structures to handle complex data.
Secret Auctions: Bids are not visible to other participants.


Example
Here's a brief example of how the auction process works:

Participant A: Places a bid of $200.
Participant B: Places a bid of $150.
Participant C: Places a bid of $250.
At the end of the auction, the program will reveal that Participant C is the highest bidder with $250.
